# 🔐 Image Encryption Tool using Python  
A beginner-friendly project to encrypt and decrypt images using **pixel manipulation** techniques with Python.

This project introduces the concept of simple visual cryptography using pixel-wise operations.



## ✅ Key Features

✨ Encrypt and decrypt images using pixel-level operations  
🧠 Simple XOR-based encryption logic (reversible)  
🖼️ Supports multiple image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG)  
⚡ Lightweight script – easy to understand and extend  



## 📚 What I Learned

🎯 Basics of **image processing** with OpenCV  
🎯 Manipulating pixels using **NumPy arrays**  
🎯 Implementing reversible logic (XOR) for encryption  
🎯 Writing clean and modular Python code
